# Bharath_intern
👋 **Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

Hello, I'm Krishna Mukund, a dedicated enthusiast in the field of machine learning. I recently completed the Bharath Intern in the machine learning domain, and I'm excited to share the outcomes of the three engaging tasks that I worked on.

🚀 **Projects from Bharath Intern:**

1. **House Price Prediction:**
   - Implemented a robust model to predict house prices.
   - Explored various features and applied advanced regression techniques.
  
2. **Wine Quality Prediction:**
   - Developed a predictive model to assess the quality of wines.
   - Employed classification algorithms to distinguish between different wine qualities.

3. **Iris Flower Classification:**
   - Tasked with classifying Iris flowers using machine learning.
   - Utilized techniques to differentiate between different species of Iris flowers.

🔍 **What to Expect:**
Dive into my repositories to explore these projects along with other machine learning endeavors. I'm committed to refining and expanding my skills, and I'm eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.
